      Hi, I'm Yujin Won. I'm a student in CPA program of Seneca College.
      <br/><br/>
      I love that feeling right when I deploy code, knowing that real people get to use in their daily lives.
      <br/><br/>
      And I love the accessibility and infinite possibilities that coding brings.
      <br/><br/>
      This is my first Angular App that I'm making for WEB422 Assignment :)
